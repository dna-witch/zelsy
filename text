 It was a good day! I met up with my old friend. Invited her to my house, offered some pastries I baked, straight from the oven, and some delicious ice cream my father had bought. We chatted a long time and then I sent her off to see a theatre play with her parents. I love these incredible snowy days, it’s so nice to have a walk and hearing the snow crunch under your feet.
Then I watched a nature documentary on TV about a Swedish moose named Ferdinand – ‘The White Moose’. It’s so cute, go watch it if you can.
Tomorrow I’m meeting up with that friend again to go to a free concert! Life’s pretty neat 
It was a hard day! I had a pop quiz in one of my classes that I did not do well on. 
"I wrote in my diary once to remember to be mad at my mom when I wake up the next day, because she made me go to bed early. It read '1) Wake up 2) Get dressed 3) Stay mad at mom 4) Eat breakfast'"
